# Surface-Temperature-Analysis
This app took Zonal annual means (the csv version) from NASA website: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ and visualize it in a line chart
using the Chart.js library.
It is a great exercise for how wants to learn how to retrieve, collect, and store tabular data.
You can play around with it by changing the border color or the background color or use different data and different type of chart such as 
doughnut & pie chart, bar chart, radar chart,... Also, you can use other libraries such as P5, D3,...
Happy Hacking!!
